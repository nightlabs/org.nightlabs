	 * The top level entries of an entity tree will always be the categories themselves.
	 * The {@link ITreeContentProvider} returned here is used to determine 
	 * the elements of a category and their children. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The returned provider's {@link IStructuredContentProvider#getElements(Object)} 
	 * method can be called with the parent {@link IEntityTreeCategory} 
	 * as inputElement. This is when to obtain the categories top-level children.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that {@link IStructuredContentProvider#getElements(Object)} 
	 * can also be called with an inputElement equal to an object returned 
	 * in the getElements() or getChildren() methods. This is  when a {@link DrillDownAdapter}
	 * is used. The implementation of getElements will have to check this 
	 * in order to support such adapters. Best practise will be to return 
	 * a list of node-elements when the input is a category and
	 * delegate to the node-objects in other cases.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The {@link ITreeContentProvider#getParent(Object)} is also used when {@link DrillDownAdapter}s
	 * are used and should return the category when called with an element
	 * returned in {@link IStructuredContentProvider#getElements(Object)}.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note, that the category is responsible for retrieving the data (<b>not</b> the
	 * content providers). That means,
	 * even though every tree has its own content provider, the data should be
	 * loaded from the server only once per category. Additionally, the category
	 * must track changes on this data, while there is someone interested in it.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * In order to fulfill this contract efficiently, an {@link IEntityTreeCategoryContentConsumer}
	 * is passed to this method, every time a new content provider is requested.
	 * Knowing who actually uses the generated content provider allows for lazy
	 * data retrieval and discarding of all data and remote listeners when the last
	 * consumer has been disposed. That means:
	 * <ul>
	 *	<li>
	 *	A category should not retrieve any data, before the first content provider asks
	 *	the category for it.
	 *	</li>
	 *	<li>
	 *	The category should not register any modification/lifecycle listeners, before
	 *	it has loaded the data.
	 *	</li>
	 *	<li>
	 *	The category should discard all data and remove all listeners after the last
	 *	consumer is disposed. Therefore, the category should use
	 *	{@link IEntityTreeCategoryContentConsumer#addDisposeListener(org.eclipse.swt.events.DisposeListener)}
	 *	and track by means of a reference counter whether data and listeners are still
	 *	needed.
	 *	</li>
	 *	<li>
	 *	It is fine, if the category notifies all content consumers about changes
	 *	(via {@link IEntityTreeCategoryContentConsumer#contentChanged(ContentChangedEvent)},
	 *	after the first content provider required the data to be loaded. In other words,
	 *	the category does not need to track, which content provider already asked for data
	 *	in order to filter the {@link ContentChangedEvent} distribution.
	 *	</li>
	 * </ul> 
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param contentConsumer The content consumer for whom the new content provider is created. This
	 *		consumer will be disposed some time later in its lifecycle and this category needs to be notified
	 *		about it via a {@link DisposeListener}. When there is no consumer existing anymore, the category
	 *		must release all resources (including listeners in the server) until a new consumer requires the
	 *		data to be reloaded.
	 *
	 * @return A <em>new</em> {@link ITreeContentProvider} to use with this category.
