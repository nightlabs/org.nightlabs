The files 'JFireSecurityConfiguration.java' and 'JFireSecurityConfigurationEntry.java' are copied from the project JFireBaseClientLib
on every NightlyDist. They are required to perform a login into the JFireServer and since they may also be used from other projects, we
placed them in the project JFireBaseClientLib.
